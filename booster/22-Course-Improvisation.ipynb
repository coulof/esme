    "Binary search is an algorithm for finding a specific `value` in a sorted list or array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. Here's how it works:\n",
    "* Start with two boundaries, `low` and `high`, representing the range of elements to search\n",
    "* Then calculate the `middle` index ; use the `//` operator for the integer division\n",
    "* Compare the middle element with the target value:\n",
    "  * If the `middle` element is equal to the target, the search is successful, and the index is returned\n",
    "  * If the `middle` element is greater than the target, update `high = mid - 1` to search the left half\n",
    "  * If the `middle` element is less than the target, update `low = mid + 1` to search the right half.\n",
    "* Repeat until the `value` is found ; or not...\n",
